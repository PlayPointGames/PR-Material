<p> Credits are a currency for PlayPointGames, and can be used in various ways on the website:</p>
<p> They can be purchased, or earnt through completing various tasks or entering competitions</p>
<p> They can be used to buy ingame items, run your own tasks, or show an advert</p>
<p> Lastly they can be withdrawn and converted into real world currency. Our currency is pegged to US Dollars.</p>

<h2> Can I create multiple accounts or create accounts for others in my household?  </h2>
<p> No, you may not use multiple accounts, that goes against the requirements set by our clients. Creating multiple accounts risks getting those accounts banned from the site.</p>

<h2> How do I change my Nickname or set my EU avatar name?   </h2>

<h2> If others use my referral link and complete tasks do I get a bonus? </h2>
<p> Yes, you'll get 10% of what they earn credited to your account. Once you have been rewarded 10 Credits from the referral this bonus will end, and there is no secondary level referral bonus. You can find your referral link in your account settings, please refrain from over promoting your link to the point of spamming.</p>

<h2> I have an idea for a game but no idea about programming or creating graphics, can you help? </h2>
<p> The thing is, many of us can think of good ideas for games, but to understand the level of commitment required to create and launch games, we believe you need some experience or be willing to put the time in yourself to create parts of the game. We are a small team, and don't have the time resources to take only ideas to fruitition. Having said that, we can point you in the right direction to get the knowledge and skills you'll need. </p>
